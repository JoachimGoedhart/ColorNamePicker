# ColorNamePicker
A set of tools that give a name to a color

### ColorNamePicker.ijm
This is an ImageJ macro that can be used to name colors. After running or installation, point-and-click on a RGB image the RGB code will be translated to a colorname.

#### Improvements
- Add more lists of colornames+RGB (that users can select)
- Copy captured color to clipboard or colorpicker
- Better distance measure?

#### History
This was originally a colorpicker plugin for MacOS [(link)](https://colornamepicker.soft32.com/)
